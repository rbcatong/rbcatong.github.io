I just wanted to write my excitement of finishing a lab myself! I usually ask for help, but I didnt! Today is a good day because it feels like everything's coming together. I'm excited and can envision myself closer and closer to the finish line. After close to 9 months, I have a schedule fit for me. I currently write down which section I should finish every week and make sure I hit that deadline. With work in the way, I hope to squeeze at least 2 hrs everyday towards coding. I think object oriented ruby is the hardest that I've ever encountered.. It's definitely something that needs practice because after the 3rd lab or practice, it helped me understand it much better.
