Coding is very much like baking. Each ingredient is measured and placed in the mixing bowl so the final product can be complete. Coding on the other hand is similar by you'd have to place each term with its correct form. Each step of code is placed in a proper way or else it wouldn't make sense. Just like putting toe nail clippings in a mixing bowl for a recipe of chocolate cake, it wouldn't make sense. 

So far I've learned HTML and CSS! Both languages are very interesting to work with. It brings me back to the old xanga days where I would copy the layouts and I remembered fidgeting with it, to make sure I had the right combination. I hope to one day make my own website. Maybe it can do something with my new puppy that I got this past month :)! Aside from taking care of the new puppy and coding, it's been great. Just have to do it one step at a time, so I know what to fix when a road bump comes along!
