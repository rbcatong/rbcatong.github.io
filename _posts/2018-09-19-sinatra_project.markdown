So it has been a while since I've written in my blog. In this project, I feel like I definitely understand coding more now. In my previous project of Ruby CLI, it definitely took me longer to plan what I was going to do. The previous labs helped me set up what I wanted my project to look like and what to expect in the project. This project is an application where users can keep track of their routines day to day. I wanted to do this because I have recently started the habit of keeping a good skincare routine. So each day I would have to be able to remember what I have to start with and what products I'll be using to cleanse and moisturize my skin. Therefore this routine journal can help me keep track of what I need to do day by day. 

When I first started this project, I had decided to start a plan on what each route would be doing and what would be needed in each route. I definitely felt this project was more comfortable to build because I was able to use the browser and visually see what needed to be done. 

I've learned so far that I can seed my own data so I can see it work properly on my application! As well as build on my HTML skills. There are so many cool things that I can design onto my application such as creating links to navigate as well as having a scroll bar for options. This CRUD app was a great project to build because I can understand how each route functions with one another. The controllers are the ones holding the routes, models are the ones that allows us to have many or belongs to relationships for the controllers. Views are the ones that allows us to design our application and for data to be rendered. I finally understood how yield was important in my application because it provides me with a great header without writing extended lines of code. Overall, a very fun project to finish!
