I have finally reached the Rails Project and I'm super excited to finish it! My idea is to allow users to review beauty products and rate them. I chose this because I always do this when I purchase beauty products. I thought it would be great to create my own version of it. I enjoy looking at the reviews because it helps me factor my decision of what to buy. 

I had hit a road bump when I was trying to show the layout of the home, but it wouldnt show on the page. I had realized when I put yield, it would render twice on what was on the page. And also I realized that there was code that I had erased in application.html.erb and I needed that certain code in order to display a layout. In the application.html.erb, this is the location of where flash messages can be defined. By including a certain code in the application.html.erb, you're then able to define which flash messages after an action is completed. 

Another thing I've learned is how to install facebook omniauth into my project. It's VERY VERY important to read the instructions carefully. Certain routes needed to be written in order to allow a facebook login and regular login. You can also change the route names in order to have one login method working vs. another. 

Throughout this whole project, it seems like I understand rails a lot better compared to when I only had to pass tests. In each method that is written in the controller, the variables have to be defined or else the view won't be able to understand what variable is needed. Also by drawing out the flow of what I'd like my application to be as helped a lot. It makes it easier to understand  and allows me to make certain methods to incoporate that action in my application.
