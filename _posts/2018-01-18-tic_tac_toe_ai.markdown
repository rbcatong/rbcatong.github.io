So i just finished this project with a friend that I made on slack. And I am so glad to be finished with this project, it was hard, but definitely a rewarding feeling. My partner was the best for my first time of having a partner. We didn't have any issues which helped run everything smoothly. So the things I learned about this was understanding how a CLI works. How classes and methods work together. The hardest part was probably the AI which is still a little confusing to me. By collaborating, it really helped because we were able to divide the work and understand different coding styles. And after submitting and looking at the solution, I realized that most of the code could've been in simpler terms. 

I've come to realize that all these methods can just be put in plain english. If I were to put everything in psuedo code, it would be easier to code for me. Super excited to tackle my first CLI project next.
