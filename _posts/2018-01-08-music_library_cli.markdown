This is a lab where I'm actually starting to understand things. Object-oriented Ruby is probably one of the hardest things to do. I noticed most or a lot of the code is plain english. By writing it in plain english for myself it really helps to understand what I'm coding. 

Update, just finished the lab!!!  That was probably one of the hardest labs ever. I had learn how to invoke a method, instantiate the method. And being able to pass the tests helped me feel accomplished. It really brought together how I used modules. Also using a lot of methods that Ruby as a language contains. There is always some method to help the coding of the method to be easier to write. 

Also another thing that I have learned is to use binding.pry because it really helps to understand what is the argument passing in and what the method is needed to do. The tests are also a big help because it really tells you in plain english what is needed to be done in each method. Learning new terms like trigger, and I was able to solve it by myself, which was calling the method within the class. 

First look of command line interface really requires a lot of thinking and how does the user experience the program. It was a tough lab, but I'm determined to finally finish the portion of Ruby!!
