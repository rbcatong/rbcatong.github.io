I just wanted to write on how I enjoy learning Javascript now. It feels definitely a lot easier since I've learned Ruby on Rails. I'm determined to finish most of the sections by the end of this month: October. So far I've learned about variables and DOM nodes. DOM nodes is a bit confusing to understand. From what I learned it seems like HTML and CSS is involved and it allows us to replace elements in Javascript.
