There was this one lab that I thought I wouldn't be able to complete. I basically had to mimic the html and css from one image to another. It was interesting to see, I was able to understand what I was doing. In the beginning of the lab I had thoughts of "I'm not going to finish it", "its super hard so I won't be able to do it". BUT I DID IT!! It was surprisingly easy and I'm just happy that I accomplished something I didn't think of accomplishing.
