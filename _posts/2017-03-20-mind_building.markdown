From we were young, our minds constantly build. It can happen while waiting for the bus or taking a long hot shower; thoughts build and connect to become ideas. It's funny because you can be thinking about one thing and it can lead to another thought in a matter of seconds. That's what coding feels like. 

I attended University at Buffalo, I majored in psychology and minored in English. I chose psychology because I enjoyed observing the way people work. Just like learning theories and applying them to real life, it was similar to coding. Funny thing is, I had originally majored in Computer Science after switching from a biological sciences major. I hated it. Maybe it was the idea of taking so many classes and also being scared that I wouldn't do well..

I remember when I first decided to give coding a try. It was January 2017, fairly recent, and it was because of Birchbox. I had received an email about a scholarship for women wanting to learn to code. My boyfriend who had actually gone through a bootcamp himself, found success in coding. I thought, if he could do it, why can't I? I filled out the application and it had led me to learn.co where I took some prep courses. It was a bit challenging at first, but I was able to understand and overcome what I had thought was hard. I loved that I was able to pass the tests and rethinking why did it work and how did I make it work. I used the idea of using what I learned and applied it to my labs. It was awesome to utilize what I learned, I had the ability to build something new. 

So now I have officially started my online web development class and it has been hard to stay consistent. I will try to build a daily week chart in where I can supply time for my studies. I hope to improve my coding and be better from when I first started!
