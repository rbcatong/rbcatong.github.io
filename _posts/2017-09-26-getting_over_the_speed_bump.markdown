I have finally decided to take back the reign and steer myself to the finish line. Since end of August, I haven't touched any coding material and it makes me feel guilty because I wanted to take this on, yet I am not making any moves. This past week I had met with one of the Flatiron coaches, Ian, and it helped me get over the speed bump. From his explaining, I just had to do it. The simple Nike logo "Just do it" is my motto nowadays. If you don't do it, you'll never get it done. Right after meeting with Ian, I really wanted to take a nap and just do the coding later. However, I didn't. I opened up learn.co finished my media queries, asked a question on the help chat and COMPLETED WHAT I NEEDED TO DO. It was a great feeling because I had finally finished the bump in the road. Even though I wanted to complete it faster and just drive right through the speed bump. I couldn't because I didn't know how to get around it. It was tough, and unfortuntately for me the next day, MY INFORMATION DIDN'T EVEN SAVE! I had to complete the lab yet again, and it was a bit tough since I didn't remember what I had written. So hopefully now I can just stay on this grind and finish by Jan. of 2018.
