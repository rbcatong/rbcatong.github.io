I really dont know if these two feelings can really go together. I'm frustrated that I don't have enough time to do this myself, but determined to finish everything. I'm frustrated that I have other things to tend to as well as doing this course. It gives me a headache when I have to do other things for other people while I HAVE SO MUCH TO DO ALREADY. So far, I feel like I'm doing as much as I can, but I also feel like I can be doing much more. Basically I want to be the best programmer I can be, but it doesn't feel like it. I'm wondering what else can I do to become a better programmer?
