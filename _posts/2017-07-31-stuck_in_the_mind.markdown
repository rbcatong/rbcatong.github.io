I seem to be having trouble focusing on my lessons. I seem to repeat that a lot in my blog, but it's true. I tell myself that I'd complete a lesson when I get home, but I don't. I'm interested in creating a website with the knowledge I know now, but at the same time I don't know a lot enough to create something just yet. Currently on the search for a planner that allows me to keep track of daily goals. 

I'm currently enrolled in the Girls Develop It newsletter and I was stoked to find out that there was a hackathon collaborating with Maybelline!! Unfortunately it was over capacity :( ! My future goal is to work at a beauty company as a software developer. It'd be a dream come true.
