I can look back now and say wow this is completely different. I'm not the same person I was when I started. I didn't know what it meant to made sure my indenting was right. I didn't know how to make variables or how to do HTML or CSS. It's completely different for me. I think the biggest struggle for me is asking for help. I can ask for help, but I still feel like I'm not getting over the hump. Like why can't I just do it by myself. I want to be able to solve everything myself. But for now I can only be better.
