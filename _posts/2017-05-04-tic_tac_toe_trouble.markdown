Triple threat of tic tac toe is pushing me to learn Ruby. There are times when I can be stuck on a lab for hours at a time and I'm afraid to ask for help. I realized that it's okay to ask for help, but at the same time to understand what I know and do not know. Yesterday I was stuck on a lab for 3 hours until I finally decided to ask a question. It was hard for me because I felt that asking a question meant accepting defeat. But it wasn't. It helped me understand what I didn't know before. I will be able to apply it to the future labs.

I'm going to start working again soon and I need to start a study plan that allows me to work on learn and work. I really hope to finish by November because I feel like it's achievable. I'm hoping to work in a beauty company as software developer!! It's something I've been dreaming of. This path is going to be long, but worth it.
