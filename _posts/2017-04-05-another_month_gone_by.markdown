Wow, it's April already. I remember just starting with the bootcamp prep not too long ago. Currently on Ruby basics, doesn't seem like much at the moment. It's kind of hard for me to think of what to write when I'm just learning the basics. However I see that I am using what I've been learning and applying it to the labs. Is it cause I'm not making anything from scratch yet? I am really having a hard time staying consistent with my work. Maybe it'd help by going to the school. 

One thing I can tell you is that by learning the basics, it lets me think about how similar it was to the javascript basics that I was learning about. I go to the gym and realize it's the same as learning. I learn to push myself over the hump beause thats when it becomes easier. Soon enough, I'll be half way there. So what I remember from Ruby is that the way you write the code is extremely important. When you miss a few spaces, it hurts you in the end. It helps to be organized and to follow through with your code. Also the most important thing is how you present the code. By switching a variable declaration and the method can change your code drastically. It reminds me of when you write a letter and you put the name or address in random places. It wouldn't make sense to anyone.

I am excited to start building my projects. I do know that it is by scratch so it'll be exciting to apply what I've learned. I hope to be going to more meet-ups so I can see how other people are doing.
