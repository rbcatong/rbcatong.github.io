It's been 3 months since I've started this program. I'm still learning about Ruby Basics, but I feel like I get lost when it comes to the hard stuff.  In a way when I do my projects, it brings me to seeing that I'm still having trouble understanding my basics. I don't want to go on without understanding what I'm writing first. I need to start setting a guide on when to start the lessons.

So for this post I'm going to describe how arguments work when you call a method. In order to call the method, you need to put in the argument that is necessary to call a method. In a way, you're using the specific item that belongs in an argument. This helps me to remember what I mean by calling a method. I also noticed that in most code, you can just copy and paste the method. It's useful to know that your resources are right there in front of you.
