I am doing better than the past month, that's considered progress right? I have finally found out what works for me and what doesn't.  Firstly, staying at home trying to code does not work for me. Actually, doing any work at home absoloutely does NOT work for me. First time ever it helped to stop by a coffee shop so I can study. It was funny because I would be able to work better if I saw other people working next to me. There were a lot of people reciting a play/movie, practicing storylines. The stereotype is true! A lot of people enjoy going to coffee shops like theatre, from what I've seen.

The problem that I seemed to have with doing labs is; I seem to think way too much into it when it's not necessary. I would sometimes get frustrated because I would be doing too much and making it way harder than it is. There was a lab that I had completed yesterday and the answer was fairly simple. I was reading a lot into the context of the problem which caused me to not understand what I was doing. I was on the right path, but I also did realize every little thing counts in coding. The amount of spacing, the way you put the brackets, it can make a huge difference when completing tests. 

I have been working on a lab that needed me to make sure if a space was taken on the board. I got really stuck on it because everytime I did it, there was a syntax error. I even asked for help on learn, but it still had the same outcome. Maybe it was just something wrong with the program. Well, there's more to learn now.
