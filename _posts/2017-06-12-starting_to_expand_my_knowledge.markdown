So far along my journey, I have been trying to understand as much as possible. But I feel in order to grasp this information, it means more practice. I'm interested in learning different languages also because I hope to one day build an app/website. 

I'm currently learning HTML and it's actually not as hard as I thought it'd be. I haven't learned to make the background of the websites yet, but just learning how to create the images for the websites. I enjoyed this lesson the most because it was something visual to see. It was a nice change from passing tests to be able to see something I can visually create.

This is just the first step of creating something visually, but I'm excited to create a full website that I can call my own!
