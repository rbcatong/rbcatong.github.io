So.... it's been a while! After completing the CLI Data Gem, I was super excited and nervous to go through with my first assessment. I had no idea what to expect and I felt prepared, but boy was I wrong. As I was doing the assessment, the questions I was asked made me feel very underprepared. It felt frustrating because I thought I was prepared, but I really wasn't. It definitely made me realize that I really needed to understand the concepts before moving forward. 

I understand how objects are made now in Ruby and how each method works with arguments. How if else statements work and how it can create a gem like my project. Nokogiri definitely inspired me to code more just because I'm able to understand how each object can be created from something from a website. 

Now that it's over, Activerecord is probably the best thing that has ever happened!! By having all the code provided because methods are already written is such a lifesaver!! It's been a long process, but there is a lot to learn!
